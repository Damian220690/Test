            <p>In this week's Premier Skills English Podcast, Jack and Rich talk about some strange football stories. Your task is to guess if these stories are real or if they are 'fake news'. </p>
            <p>The language focus is on phrases we use when we think someone is lying. Do you know the phrases 'economical with the truth' or 'that's a load of baloney'? We also have a new football phrase for you to guess. Enjoy!</p>
            <p>Jack and Rich know each other well so they speak to each other in an informal way. The use of 'shut up' could be rude if you didn't know someone well or it was a more formal situation. </p>
